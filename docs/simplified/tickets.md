# Ticket System - Simple Guide 🎫

## What Does This Module Do?

The Ticket System helps you report problems, suggest new features, and communicate with the farm management team. Think of it like a suggestion box or help desk:
- Report things that aren't working
- Ask for new features
- Suggest improvements
- Get help from administrators

## Main Sections

### 📋 All Tickets
See all tickets submitted by everyone on the farm. You can filter to find specific tickets or see what others are reporting.

### 📝 My Tickets
View only the tickets YOU created. This helps you track the status of your reports and requests.

### ➕ Create Ticket
Submit a new issue, feature request, or suggestion.

This is blocking our feeding schedule.

## Understanding Priority Levels

## Using Comments

### What Are Comments?
Comments are like a conversation thread on your ticket. You and the admin team can discuss the issue, ask questions, and share updates.

### How to Add a Comment

1. **Open your ticket** by clicking on it
2. **Scroll down** to the "Add Comment" section
3. **Type your message** in the box
4. **Click "Add Comment"**

That's it! Your comment appears immediately.

### When to Comment

**Good reasons to comment:**
- ✅ Admin asked you a question
- ✅ You have more information to share
- ✅ Situation changed or got worse
- ✅ You tested the fix and it works (or doesn't)
- ✅ You found a workaround
- ✅ Related information discovered

**Don't comment for:**
- ❌ Creating a new, unrelated issue (make a new ticket instead)
- ❌ Asking "when will this be done?" repeatedly
- ❌ Going off-topic

### Example Good Comments

```
"I tested the fix and Tank 3 dispenser is working perfectly now. Thanks!"
```

```
"This also happens in Tank 7, not just Tank 3. Should I create a separate ticket?"
```

```
"The problem started after we updated the feeding schedule yesterday."
```

```
"I found a temporary workaround: manually opening the dispenser from the
control panel works, but the automatic schedule doesn't."
```

### Editing Your Comment

If you made a mistake:
1. Find your comment
2. Click the ✏️ **edit icon**
3. Fix your text
4. Click "Save"

**NOTE:** You can only edit YOUR OWN comments, and only if the ticket is still open.

### Deleting Your Comment

If you want to remove a comment:
1. Find your comment
2. Click the 🗑️ **trash icon**
3. Confirm deletion

**WARNING:** This permanently deletes the comment. You can't undo it!

## Tips for Good Tickets

### ✅ DO:

**Be Specific**
- Bad: "Tank not working"
- Good: "Tank 3 water sensor not recording temperature"

**Include Details**
- Tank ID or number
- When problem started
- What you already tried
- Error messages you saw

**Be Polite**
- Remember: admins are helping you!
- Use please and thank you
- Be patient

**One Issue Per Ticket**
- Don't combine multiple problems
- Create separate tickets for different issues
- Easier to track and fix

**Check First**
- Look at existing tickets
- Someone may have reported it already
- Comment on existing ticket instead of duplicating

### ❌ DON'T:

**Don't Be Vague**
- "Something's wrong" - too vague!
- "It doesn't work" - what doesn't work?
- "Fix this" - fix what exactly?

**Don't Demand**
- Not: "FIX THIS NOW!!!"
- Better: "This is affecting our feeding schedule, can you help?"

**Don't Spam**
- One ticket is enough
- Don't create duplicates
- Use comments for updates

**Don't Include Passwords**
- NEVER put passwords in tickets
- Ask admin for secure way to share if needed

---

## Common Questions

### "How long until my ticket is fixed?"

It depends on:
- **Priority:** Critical issues are handled first
- **Complexity:** Some fixes are quick, others take time
- **Resources:** Admins work on multiple tickets

**What you can do:**
- Check the status for updates
- Read comments from admin
- Be patient
- If urgent, mention why in the description

---

### "Can I change the priority myself?"

**No.** Only administrators can set priority. They decide based on:
- How many people are affected
- Impact on operations
- Safety or revenue concerns
- Other urgent issues

---

### "My ticket is still 'Open' after 2 days, is that normal?"

Yes, it can be normal if:
- It's lower priority
- Admin is working on critical issues first
- More information is needed
- It's being reviewed

**If concerned:**
- Add a comment asking for an update
- Be polite
- Don't spam multiple comments

---

### "Can I delete my ticket?"

**No.** Only admins can close tickets. But you can:
- Comment saying you want it closed
- Explain why (problem solved, no longer needed, etc.)
- Admin will close it

---

### "I created a ticket by mistake, what do I do?"

**Option 1:** Add a comment saying it was a mistake and ask admin to close it.

**Option 2:** If you haven't submitted yet, just close the dialog and don't submit.

---

### "The issue came back after the ticket was closed"

**Create a NEW ticket!**
- Mention it happened before
- Include the old ticket number if you remember
- Explain what's different this time

Example:
```
Title: Feed dispenser stuck again in Tank 3

Description: This is the same issue as ticket #42 which was fixed
last week. It started happening again this morning. The dispenser
was working fine for 5 days after the fix.
```
